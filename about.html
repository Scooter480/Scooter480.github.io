				<h1>About River</h1>
				<p>Hi, I'm River! I'm a 19 year old lesbian transfem silly goose from Michigan, USA. I don't have any one thing that defines me, I've learned a little bit about a lot of things, including programming, web development, managing servers, 3D modeling, music production, video production, speedrunning, speedcubing, and probably more.  You can read my ramblings about my interests <a href="interests/">here</a>. I try to be creative sometimes and occasionally I make stuff I like, mostly for fun or with friends. I know that makes it sound like I do a lot and I'm super productive but I spend a lot of time just sitting around and staying silly. I'm currently in university majoring in comupter science, although I'm not sure what I'll do after that. I've been making personal websites with html and css since 2018, and this is where I've ended up. I hope you enjoy my page :3</p>
