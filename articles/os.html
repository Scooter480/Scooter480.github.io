            <h1>Operating Systems</h1>
            <p>Until recently, I've been a massive GNU/Linux fangirl. I admired its freedom and customizability, and made fun of people who use proprietary, inferior operating systems. Recently, however, I've come to a realization that each OS has it's advantages and disadvantages, and in this article, I hope to explain that.</p>

            <h2>Microsoft Windows</h2>
            <p>Windows is by far the most popular desktop operating system, with over 80% of the market share. With that comes many advantages. Windows has the best software compatibility, making it a good all around operating system. You can game, code, CAD, edit videos... the list goes on. While privacy and security are certainly a major issue, and the UI has its problems, it gets work done, and isn't as bad as I've made it out to be in the past.</p>

            <h2>macOS</h2>
            <p>I've certainly been guilty in the past of making fun of macOS for being a locked down OS for people who don't know what they're doing. Recently, however, I've come to like it a lot. It's visually appealing, has good software compatibility, and being based on UNIX, it's rock solid. Its lack of customization is a major drawback for me, and for gaming and programming, it isn't the best option. It's still great for graphic design, audiovisual editing, and CAD, so it certainly has its place in a professional environment (especially if you can afford a Mac Pro). Personally, I just wish I could have the old icons back from before Yosemite.</p>

            <h2>GNU/Linux</h2>
            <p>GNU/Linux is still my favorite operating system. From its freedom to its customizability to its versatility, it's one of the best. GNU/Linux comes in many distributions (aka distros) for different use cases. Debian is amazing for servers, Arch is great if you want to tinker and install the software of your choice, Pop_OS! is great for gaming and ease of use, and Alpine is good if you want to get the GNU out of GNU/Linux. You can use a plethora of desktop environments, window managers, and themes to make your desktop look however you like, and to fit your use case. Not to mention it's the best for programming. While its software compatibility is less than that of Windows and Macintosh, it's still infinitely useful, and will forever hold a special place in my heart</p>

            <h2>BSD</h2>
            <p>BSD, or Berkley Software Distribution, is a free operating system from UC Berkley, which is similar to UNIX. While certainly not the most popular desktop OS, it sees occasional use, and has its fans. BSD comes in a few flavors, although not as many as Linux. FreeBSD is the most popular, and while it gets some desktop use, it also helps run some large servers. OpenBSD is for security nuts who care about privacy above all else. Its developers have their priorities straight, notably not implimenting feautures such as bluetooth, as they don't use them. NetBSD is quite interesting, and will run on anything from your gaming pc, to your old iMac, to a fucking Sega Dreamcast. It's truly a cool OS, and while I wouldn't daily drive it, I'm certainly impressed.</p>
            <h2> Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Overall, each operating system has its use case. Average Joes and avid gamers go with Windows. Artists and people who want an easy to use OS go to macOS. Hackers, programmers, and people who value free software use GNU/Linux, and turbo loser nerds use BSD. There's an OS for every use case, and while I wish there was an OS that combined my favorite parts of all of them, I'm not sure I'd want that. After all, why try and create a new standard? We all know how <a href="https://xkcd.com/927">that'll go</a>.</p>
