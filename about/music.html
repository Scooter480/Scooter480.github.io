				<h1>Music</h1>
				<p>I didn't really care about music until high school. Around then I started to discover and appreciate music for the first time. I started my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/13KDOSiZ2wlmTwkDsI7UyX?si=4717b76f397f49c7">spotify playlist</a> that I still use to this day, and started listening to albums. Some albums, such as <em>Hybrid Theory</em> really resonated with me at the time, and others, such as <em>Enter the Wu Tang</em> were highly regarded classic albums. I explored a lot of 90s hip hop at the time, and later listened to some of the best from the 2000s and 2010s as well. I listened to a lot of classic, progressive, and alternative rock as well. I still listen to a lot of this music, although I'm trying to branch out a little.</p>
				<img class="icon" src="../images/carti.jpg" title="Carti goes Morbius" alt="Edited lyrics to M3tamorphosis by Playboi Carti saying &quot; I feel like Morbius &quot;">
				<p>As I got into music, I started to amass a small collection of physical music as well. Most of my music was bought at <a href="https://www.shopflipsiderecords.com/">Flipside Records</a> in Berkely, MI. I prefer to get CDs, as they're generally cheaper, have better liner notes, and I can play them at home and in my car, as well as rip them to play on my computer. I have some vinyl records as well, which are fun because you get to watch them spin around and whatnot. I have some cassettes, but I don't really look for prerecorded cassettes, and usually make mixtapes instead. I've even made mixtapes for a friend before, since his car only has a cassette deck and the radio doesn't work.</p>

				<p>To listen to music, I have a stereo system that I've slowly amassed over the years. At the heart is a Denon DRA-55V AV receiver. Attached are some Jensen speakers I got for $10 at a garage sale: 2 on the left, 2 on the right, and a subwoofer. The turntable is an Audio Technica AT-LP60 with a diamond tip eliptical stylus. It's pretty good especially for the price. I'm hardly an audiophile so I don't really care to upgrade it, it sounds good to me. It has a usb port so I can digitize any records I get, which is nice if they aren't on streaming services and I want to listen on the go. The CD player is acutally a Toshiba DVD player, which my family has had for ages. We use the Xbox for DVDs now, so I snagged the old one. I also listen to CDs in my car. The tape deck is a JVC KD-V22 from 1983, purchased at Flipside. It has Dolby C noise reduction, which is pretty nice. I use this deck to make the afformentioned mixtapes. I also have a Raspberry Pi 3b hooked up to it, which can be streamed to via Airplay or Spoitfy, which is nice if I want to listen to anything that I don't own physically. I might get an upgraded DAC for it later.</p>
				<p>I also make music occasionally, although it's not that good. It's mostly just for fun, although I occasionally collaborate with friends, such as <a href="http://soundcloud.com/littleqw33zy">Lil Leezy</a>. I use FL Studio, and I'm a big fan of the Korg Triton synth. I only make instrumentals, I can't sing and certainly can't rap.
