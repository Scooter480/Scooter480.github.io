				<h1>Keyboards</h1>
				<p>I've been interested in keyboards for a while now, and I've amassed a small collection. I didn't think much about keyboards for a long time. I spent about 3 years using a cheap keyboard with gateron blue switches that I got for $20 until my friends started complaining that it was too loud and my mic was picking it up. I eventually got a Razer Blackwidow Elite, and used it for a couple years as well. After a while, the volume knob on that board broke and would crank the volume to 100% randomly, which wasn't fun to say the least. I got a Keychron C1 with gateron brown switches to replace that, and that's when I realized there was a larger mechanical keyboard scene. I tape and foam modded the Keychron, which gave it marginal improvements in terms of sounds, but I saw the cool custom keyboards online and got really interested in the hobby. When the group buy for the QK80 was announced, I figured it was a good opportunity to join, as it was really high quality and wasn't as egregiously priced as other custom keyboards were. I'm typing on that now with JWK Taro switches and 21KB keycaps.</p>
				<p> While "mechanical" keyboards are nicer to type on, there are some good rubber dome keyboards out there as well. Mechanical switches tend to be louder than rubber domes as well, so in the office they can have their disadvantages. At work I use an NMB RT-101 featuring NMB dome with slider switches. The slider on top of the dome makes mounting keycaps easier and makes the bottom out feel less mushy than standard rubber domes. NMB domes are strangely indivdually glued to the membrane, rather than being a sheet on top of it. It's not bad, although it's not perfect either. It's definitely better than the Dell chiclet keyboards we're given though, and it has a cool retro look and a pencil holder.

				<p>I've been working on my own custom-designed keyboard as well. It's a 40% alice-esque layout, and 3D printed. It bears resemblance to <a href="https://github.com/flurples/C-13X">Flurple's CX-13</a>, but mine is symetrical and has a few more keys. For the board I got <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PHGGGPC/ref=twister_B09PQF36JB">Gateron milky black switches</a> (a cheap, quality, heavy linear switch), and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NDH7R6M?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details">this keycap set</a>, I think it might be a GMK clone set but I don't really care.</p>
