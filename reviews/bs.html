				<h1>Belle and Sebastian - <em>Late Developers</em></h1>
				<h4>Review Date: 17 January 2023</h4>
					<p>The new album I listened to this week is <em>Late Developers</em> by <em>Belle and Sebastian</em>, a band which, surprisingly, doesn't have any members named Belle or Sebastian. The album was mainly generic indie pop, with interesting enough melodies and alright vocals. A few songs bring in some different instrumentation like synths, horns, and even flute, which all add a little variety to the record. Overall though, the record is nothing special, but also not terrible in any way besides being a little bland. While I criticized last week's <em>Anti-Flag</em> record for the same thing, it was trying to be an edgy political punk record. This isn't taking itself as seriously, so I'm not as disappointed. Plus the music was generally more enjoyable. Apparently the band's previous work is substantially better, but I haven't heard any of it. </p>
				<p><strong>5/10, Favorite Song: <em>So In The Moment</em>, Least Favorite Song: <em>I Don't Know What You See In Me</em></strong></p>
