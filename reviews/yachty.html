				<h1>Lil Yachty - <em>Let's Start Here.</em></h1>
				<h4>Review Date: 30 January 2023</h4>
					<p>Lil Yachty has made the greatest left turn in music since Radiohead's <em>Kid A</em>. Known for making trap music such as last year's <em>Poland</em>, Yachty's new album shifts into a full-on psychedelic rock experience. Yachty isn't the first rapper to make rock music, but compared to Lil Wayne and Kid Cudi's attempts, this is leagues above. Yachty's signature autotuned vocal inflections remain, now over sick guitar licks and spacey synths. The lyrics aren't the most in-depth, but that's never been the focus of his music, usually taking a backseat to vocal inflections and production. Some tracks like the spoken-word <em>:(failure(:</em> are more introspective however. The instrumentation varies, with some tracks such as <em>the BLACK seminole</em> and <em>IVE OFFICIALLY LOST ViSiON!!!!</em> feeling maximal, and others such as <em>running out of time</em> are more toned down and comfy. Overall Yachty took a creative risk, and it payed the fuck off.  </p>
				<p><strong>8/10, Favorite Song: <em>the BLACK seminole</em>, Least Favorite Song: <em>pRETTy</em></strong></p>
