			<h1>Riverside - <em>Id.Entity</em></h1>
			<h4>Review Date: 23 January 2023</h4>
				<p>This week's album was <em>Id.Entity</em> by Riverside, or as I like to call it, <em>Literally 1984: The Album</em>. I didn't even finish this project. It's just so bad. While Anti-Flag's album was bland and pretty surface level, at least its politics were bearable. This album on the other hand screams radical centrist with lyrics such as "Everyone's divided / Extreme right or extreme left / That's the only choice." Ugh. When it's not doing this it's complaining about social media and how terrible it is. I hate social media too but this album does a pretty bad job with its commentary. Not to mention the song Big Tech Brother which is where the "literally 1984" part comes from. They literally say "84."  Overall it's just so bad. The instrumentals aren't terrible and there's some interesting moments, but the lyrics are so bad it's not worth it. If you're looking for a prog album that does Orwell justice, listen to Pink Floyd's Animals instead. </p>
