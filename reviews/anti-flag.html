			<h1>Anti-Flag - <em>The Lies They Tell Our Children</em></h1>
			<h4>Review Date: 06 January 2023</h4>
				<p>I wish the album was half as good as the album cover. It's a pop-punk album, and the genre has been fairly lacking recently to my knowledge, considering the most notable albums in pop-punk this decade have been from MGK of all people. This album isn't doing the genre any favors, as while I can agree with the anti-war and anti-capitalist politics on the record, the songwriting and lyrics still leave a lot to be desired. The guitar sounds generic, as do the vocals, and I can't remember a melody from any of the songs. Punk generally isn't the most complex genre, but it's usually not this bland at least. Overall <em>Lies They Tell Our Children</em> leaves a lot to be desired, and you can find music that's similar in focus and in sound done significantly better elsewhere. For a group that's apparently been making music since the 90's, I expect better. </p>
			<p><strong>2/10, Favorite song: <em>Imperialism</em>, Least favorite song: <em>Victory or Death (We Gave 'em Hell)</em></strong></p>
